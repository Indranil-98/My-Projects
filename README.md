# My-Projects
I am trying to analyze a Facebook dataset in this short project. This is my very first project in programming. 
In this very short project, I am trying to answer 3 different questions:
  1.  Which age group is most active in my Facebook dataset based on user count?
  2.  What is the gender distribution of the users? 
  3. Which age group is most active in terms of long-term usage?
I have analyzed almost 99004 unique users based on their age, days of activity, and user count.

I am using this project as my final project in Stanford University's Code In Place 2021.
